/**
 * Gates structural parity between the English docs and their Spanish mirror.
 *
 * `src/content/docs/` holds the English pages at the top level and a full
 * Spanish mirror under `es/`. Translations drift silently: a page gets added
 * on one side only, a section is dropped mid-translation, a frontmatter key
 * (`sidebar`, `head`, `template`, …) is set in one language and forgotten in
 * the other. None of that breaks the build, so nothing catches it in review.
 *
 * This checks the four things that can be compared without reading prose:
 *   1. every English page has a Spanish twin, and vice versa;
 *   2. both twins declare the same frontmatter key paths, and the same number
 *      of entries in each sequence (values are expected to differ, that is
 *      the translation);
 *   3. both twins have the same sequence of heading levels, so a missing or
 *      extra section shows up even though the heading text is translated;
 *   4. both twins invoke the same components with the same identifying
 *      attributes, a heading can survive in both locales while the component
 *      that renders the section under it vanishes from one.
 *
 * Plus one thing that is not a comparison at all: a component tag written in a
 * `.md` page is a hard error (5). `.md` is markdown, not MDX, so Astro emits
 * the tag as raw HTML and it renders nothing. It therefore cannot be counted as
 * an invocation, and the gate used to ignore it, which meant a `.md` page
 * could lose a whole section on both sides and stay green. Every page in this
 * corpus is `.mdx` today, so that was latent, and latent is exactly how the
 * three defects listed below got in.
 *
 * ## Why this parses instead of scanning
 *
 * This file used to hand-parse markdown line by line. That approach produced
 * three defects in the same area, all of the same kind, a hand-written
 * recogniser disagreeing with the real grammar:
 *
 *   1. the HTML-comment terminator matched `-->` but not `--!>`;
 *   2. comment stripping was a chained `.replace()`, so `<!--<!-- x -->` left
 *      a bare `<!--` behind;
 *   3. code spans treated every backtick as a one-character delimiter, so a
 *      ``double-backtick`` span closed at the first tick and leaked.
 *
 * Three findings in one area say the approach was wrong, not that the patches
 * were bad. Everything structural now comes off the mdast tree produced by
 * `mdast-util-from-markdown` with the MDX extensions, the same parser stack
 * that renders this site.
 *
 * Nothing new was installed to do it. All four packages were already resolved
 * in this project's lockfile, so declaring them as direct devDependencies added
 * zero downloads (`pnpm install` reported `downloaded 0, added 0`); they are
 * pinned to exactly the versions already present so pnpm keeps linking those
 * same instances instead of resolving a second copy. Their provenance, per
 * `pnpm why`: `mdast-util-mdx` and `micromark-extension-mdxjs` via
 * `@astrojs/starlight` → `@astrojs/mdx` → `@mdx-js/mdx` → `remark-mdx`;
 * `mdast-util-from-markdown` via `@astrojs/markdown-remark` and Starlight's
 * remark plugins; `yaml` as a peer dependency of `astro` itself and via
 * `@astrojs/check`.
 *
 * The classes of bug above are gone by construction rather than by patch:
 *
 *   • a heading inside a fence, an HTML comment or an MDX `{/* … *\/}` comment
 *     is simply not a `heading` node, so it cannot be counted;
 *   • a component named inside an inline code span is text inside an
 *     `inlineCode` node, never an `mdxJsxFlowElement`, at any backtick-run
 *     length, the parser owns the delimiter rule, so #3 cannot recur;
 *   • nesting, quoting and escaping inside comments are the parser's problem,
 *     so #2 cannot recur;
 *   • setext headings, thematic breaks, indented code and MDX `import`
 *     statements are distinguished by the grammar, retiring the pile of
 *     conservative regexes that used to guess between them.
 *
 * Frontmatter is read with the `yaml` package's document AST rather than an
 * indentation scanner. Block scalars (`content: |`) are opaque for free, a
 * scalar is a leaf, so an embedded JSON-LD payload can never be mistaken for
 * more YAML keys, and malformed YAML is now reported instead of silently
 * mis-shaped.
 *
 * MDX expressions are not mdast, and are not read as text either. An attribute
 * value (`paths={[…]}`) and a body expression (`{list.map(…)}`) each carry the
 * ESTree acorn produced for them, so a component nested inside one is found by
 * walking that tree, and the identity of an expression-valued attribute is
 * derived from it. Both used to be text: the key was the expression's source
 * with whitespace runs collapsed, which claimed to be layout-independent and
 * was not, Prettier adds a trailing comma when it breaks a literal, so one
 * invocation could key two ways; and collapsing ate whitespace *inside* string
 * literals, so two different instances could key the same. A tree has neither
 * problem, because a line break and a trailing comma are not nodes and the
 * contents of a string literal are.
 *
 * ## What still reads raw text, and why
 *
 * Three things, all deliberate:
 *
 *   • Splitting frontmatter from the body. The frontmatter mdast extensions
 *     are NOT in this project's dependency tree (unlike the four parser
 *     packages, they would be a genuinely new install), and the split is an
 *     anchored delimiter match, not a parse, it locates `---` fences and
 *     hands the text between them to the YAML parser, which does the parsing.
 *   • Deciding whether a fenced block or an HTML comment was ever closed. An
 *     unclosed construct is not an error in markdown: it runs to end of file
 *     and swallows every heading after it. The tree is correct, but the
 *     outline it yields is a truncation the author did not intend, so the
 *     node's own source range is re-read to see whether a closing delimiter is
 *     actually there. Positions come from the parser; only the delimiter test
 *     is textual.
 *   • Blanking HTML comments inside an `html` node when scanning a `.md` page
 *     for stray component tags. Markdown has no comment node, so a comment
 *     inside a larger html block is part of that block's text. It is a single
 *     non-greedy pass over one node's own value, not the chained `.replace()`
 *     of defect #2, and it errs towards silence: an unclosed `<!--` blanks to
 *     the end of the node, and is separately a hard error anyway.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Structure only. Body prose, table rows and code block contents are never
 * compared, a stale translation of a paragraph whose English changed passes
 * here, and is meant to: catching that needs per-string provenance.
 *
 * Everything here is covered by the fixtures at the bottom, which run on every
 * invocation, the blind spots this gate has had were all invisible in the
 * corpus, so a regression reads as a pass unless something tests for it.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/check-i18n-parity.mjs   # exit 0 when clean, 1 on any mismatch
 *   node scripts/check-i18n-parity.mjs --self-test   # fixtures only, no corpus
